        Scalagmite release 0.1-SNAPSHOT

Scalagmite is a project that aims to ease the writing of scalable parallel
or distributed applications by using high-level abstractions. In a
Scalagmite application, everything is asynchronous: threads,
semaphores, etc. are never handled explicitly. Instead, agents are defined
which handle different message types and interact with other agents by
sending them messages.
